Sudoku solver:

An application that tries to solve a sudoku puzzles of varying
difficulty levels. It takes a "valid" sudoku board as input and
produces a solution/parital solution for the board as output.

A few test inputs for the application could be found in the
'test_inputs/' directory. The application binary could be generated
using 'make'. A simple way to test the application is to do,

	cat test_inputs/medium/3 | ./sudoku_solver.out

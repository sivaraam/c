## Sudoku Solver

A simple sudoku solver implementation that tries to solve sudoku using
the following solving techniques:

	1. [Naked single detection](http://www.sudoku9x9.com/naked_single.html)
	2. [Hidden single detection](http://www.sudoku9x9.com/hidden_single.html)
	3. [Naked double detection](http://www.sudoku9x9.com/naked_pair.html)

It gives a complete solution if the board could be solved using the mentioned
techniques else it would return a partial solution.

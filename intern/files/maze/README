maze solver

A simple application that finds the shortest path from the source
to destination in a maze which is given in the form of a BMP file.

The application can be built using 'make'. Some test inputs for the
application could be found in the 'test_inputs.bak/' folder. A simple
way to test the application for different inputs is to use the 'run_all'
script as follows:

	./run_all

Alternatively the application could be manually run as follows,

	./replace_tests
	./maze_solver.out test_inputs/BMP5.bmp

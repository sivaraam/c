## intern

This folder consists of some programs that I created while I was
attending an internship program during Feb-Mar 2018.

I learned a lot during that period. I learned:

- how to manage memory correctly
- how avoid memory leaks by implementing things the right way
  by including proper checks wherever necessary and using
  tools such as Valgrind
- how to improve the performance of the code (I even did a
  performance analysis! See, [Maze solver]('files/maze/'))
- how to increase re-usability in the code.
- and a lot more

For serious implementations that solve some bigger problems, see:

- [Maze solver](intern/files/maze/) - a program that finds the
  shortest path from source to destination in a given maze using the
  A-star algorithm.

- [Sudoku solver](intern/sudoku/sudoku_solver/) - a program that tries to solve
  sudoku puzzles using some well-known solving techniques

- [Chess move validator](intern/chess_move_validate/) - a simple library
  that could be used to validate basic chess moves

- [Chess GUI](intern/gui-gtk/chess/) - a simple GUI for the game of chess
  (using GTK+-3.0)
